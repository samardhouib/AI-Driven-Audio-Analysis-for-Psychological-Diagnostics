 In this lecture, I will talk about the treatment of hypertension. There are three aspects of hypertension which a general practitioner should take care of. Number 1. In his patients, he should detect hypertension early before any serious complications have occurred. Number 2. Once detected, he should choose the correct drug and adjust the dose to control the blood pressure, taking help of a physician in high risk cases. And number 3. He should closely follow up the patients over the years and take care that the blood pressure remains under control. Now let me first discuss about the timely detection of hypertension. For this, you should be very alert about the high incidence of hypertension in certain groups. Firstly, check the blood pressure of every patient who is more than 40 years old on first visit and then at least once a year. And if the patient is always or diabetic, check the blood pressure on every visit. If there is family history of hypertension, that is hypertension in father, mother, brother or uncle, then you should check the blood pressure every year. And you must check the blood pressure of every patient who complains of headache, gidinous, chest pain or epistaxis. To repeat, check blood pressure routinely in every patient about 40 years. Every diabetic and always patient, patients with headache, gidinous, chest pain or epistaxis and patients with family history of hypertension. Remember that a good general practitioner is one who has a very high suspicion index and only the doctor who suspects makes the diagnosis early. Now, during your examination, you have detected the blood pressure to be high. The next question is how to start the treatment. If the blood pressure is only marginally high, up to 140 by 90, then you should not be in a hurry to start drug treatment. The first thing you should remember is that the blood pressure may rise slightly due to apprehension, the tension and fear of visiting a doctor. This is also termed as white coat hypertension. So let the patient rest in the clinic for 15 minutes and then check the BP again or check the blood pressure every day for 2-3 days. And if it is persistently high, then label it as hypertension. Now how do we start the treatment? We should start with the non-pharmacological treatment first. Ask the patient to reduce salt in the diet and avoid salt-rich articles like pickles, peppers, sauce, cheese, salted biscuits, wafers, etc. Ask the patient to take regular exercise, specially walking, and if the patient is obese, weight reduction is a must. Advise good rest, sleep for 7-8 hours, and yoga for relaxation. If the patient is very anxious, advise mild tranquilizer like half a tablet of compost or rest till for 1-2 weeks. Check the blood pressure once or twice a week. With these measures, mild hypertension will usually be controlled. If not, then a small dose of anti-hypertensia like atend 25 mg or a small dose of diuretic like acid drugs 1 O.D. should be started. Here we come to the all-important question which anti-hypertensia drug should we start with. There is a very wide range of anti-hypertensia available today, and the choice will depend on the individual choice of the doctor, the tolerance and response of the patient to the drug, then specific situations like esthema, diabetes or kidney diseases where some drugs are indicated or contraindicated, and lastly the cost of the therapy, what the patient can afford. Now let us discuss this in details. Number 1. Different patients respond differently to drugs. One patient may get controlled very well on ethanol, while another's BP will just not come down with it. One patient may find amelodipin the best, while another may get leg edema with the smallest dose. So how the blood pressure responds and the side effects seen in the patient will basically determine the choice of the drug. Second factor is specific situations or diseases like esthema or diabetes or age, where certain drugs are indicated or contraindicated. For example, beta blockers should be avoided in esthema. AC inhibitors should be preferred in renal diseases and so on. We will learn more about it later. The third factor is individual choice of the doctor. Over the years you may try different drugs, but you should stick to three or four drugs for regular use. This way you get familiar with their actions, side effects, dosage adjustments and by this your expertise grows. So I would say that you must have your favorite drugs and you should stick to them. And the last factor is cost factor. What the patient can afford? Many of the patients of hypertension are elderly retired persons who have limited financial resources and for poor patients, bringing down blood pressure to normal is all that matters. Costly drugs offering slightly better cardio protective action are not worth for them because these drugs are to be taken for years. So even a small change in cost multiplies to a weak saving. Now coming to the drug treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. In a middle aged patient start treatment with a beta blocker like tab ethanolol 50 milligrams daily or tab metoprolol low press or 50 milligrams daily. In a young patient tab Cardi was 6.25 milligrams that is carvedi lol may be preferred. Beta blockers are cardio protective. They protect the patient from IHD and arrhythmias. But some patients get broncospasm with wheezing and cuff due to beta blockade. In these patients we have to stop the beta blocker and prescribe a calcium channel blocker or alpha blocker. If a patient is asthmatic or diabetic or has bready cardiac, then beta blockers should be avoided and another drug preferred. It reminds me some patients get marked bready cardiac with beta blockers. Pulsarate becomes 60, 50 or even 40. For these patients also another drug has to be preferred. The second group of drugs for primary treatment is calcium channel inhibitors. For example, tab emulo dipin like Stamelo 5 milligrams Ode or Niphadepin like tab dipin 10 milligrams Ode. The tolerance to these drugs is generally good. But some patients may experience heaviness of head, gidiness and headache, specially with Niphadepin. That may force you to change the drug. Another side effect particularly common with emulo dipin is edema of the legs and feet. Though harmless, it causes a lot of anxiety. If it persists, even after combining a diuretic, then a different drug has to be prescribed. Niphadepin and emulo dipin are excellent drugs for asthmatics. The third group of drugs is ACE inhibitors or ACE inhibitors. We can start with analaepryl like Nvas 5 milligrams Ode or remapryl like tab cardase 2.5 milligrams Ode or lysinopryl like tab listril 5 milligrams Ode. The ACE inhibitors are the drugs of choice if the patient has congestive cardiac failure or left ventricular failure or a low ejection fraction on echocardiography. In fact, in these cases with CCF or LVF, even if another drug is used to control the blood pressure, a small dose of remapryl 1.25 milligrams should be combined with it. They are also the drugs of choice if the patient has renal dysfunction or chronic renal failure. A common problem with ACE inhibitors is dry hacking cuff in some patients. The cuff does not respond to antibiotics and cuff medications. And unless a wise doctor asks about what drugs he is taking, the problem becomes intractable. So if a patient on ACE inhibitors gets cuff lasting for 2-3 weeks or more, stop the drug and prescribe emulo dipin or alpha blocker. The cuff due to ACE inhibitors does not stop immediately on stopping the drug but may take several days to several weeks. So have patients. In contrast, if there is cuff due to beta blockers, it stops immediately on stopping the drug. A subgroup of ACE inhibitors is selective angiotensin tube lockers like low sartan or telmasartan. These drugs have a better anti-hypertensia effect and they do not induce cuff so they have become popular in recent years. And they form important first line drugs to scarred the treatment of hypertension. Lastly, we have alpha blockers like presosin 2 milligrams OD or teresosin 2 milligrams OD. Alpha blockers are generally not used as first line drugs but when beta blockers or ACE inhibitors are not able to control the hypertension, we find that alpha blockers show excellent control. Alpha blockers have the undesirable side effect of postural hypotension. In such a case, the drug may be given at night or a slow release preparation like mini-press excel should be used. Alpha blockers also relax the spasm of bladder neck and relieve the symptoms of enlarged prostate. So in elderly patients with mild prosthetic symptoms who do not require a prostatectomy and alpha blocker is the drug of choice. Now that I have introduced you to the five groups of anti-hypertensia drugs, let us learn how to adjust the doses of these drugs. And first, that there is no fixed formula to decide the dose of anti-hypertensia drugs. You have to adjust the dose to achieve a normal blood pressure of around 120 by 80 millimeters of mercury. If the initial blood pressure is around 140 by 90, then start with the smallest dose like atinolol 25 milligrams or amylo-dipin 2.5 milligrams or low-sertun 25 milligrams OD. Check the blood pressure intermittently for one week. If ideal control is not achieved, increase the dose to the regular dose, that is atinolol 50 milligrams or amylo-dipin 5 milligrams or low-sertun 50 milligrams. If the blood pressure was higher, say 160 by 100 to start with, then start with the regular dose and then increase it as necessary. If the blood pressure is not controlled by the regular starting dose, instead of increasing the dose, you may add a diuretic like hydrochlorothiazide 10 milligrams OD. If this controls the blood pressure, then a combination like atinolol or low-sertun H can be prescribed so that the patient has to take a single tablet daily. If not, then increase the dose to 1 BD with hydrochlorothiazide in the morning dose. Now if the BD dosage also fails to control the hypertension adequately, then instead of increasing the dosage further, it is always more effective to add a second drug from another group. A combination of two drugs achieves better control than very high dose of a single drug and the side effects are also less. You can combine, for example, atinolol with niphidipin or amylo-dipin, calcium channel blockers that is niphidipin or amylo-dipin can be combined with any other group like AC inhibitors or low-sertun or with alpha blockers. The AC inhibitors can be combined with amylo-dipin, low-sertun or telmi-sertun. Now if a drug does not suit your patient, causes side effects or does not adequately control the blood pressure, you can always change to another drug and try. But if two drug combination fails to control the blood pressure, then do not experiment. Refer the patient to a physician or a cardiologist. While adjusting the dose, remember a few precautions, a few practical points. Give time for the drug to act. Do not expect the full effect of the drug to have occurred on the next day. When you start or change a dose, observe for three to four days. Do not change the dose every day. Secondly, start with a dose slightly less than what you expect and then increase gradually. Otherwise with a higher dose, the patient may get postural hypertension or gidiness and develop a fear for the tablets. Thirdly, before checking the blood pressure, always ask whether the patient has taken the morning dose. Many patients come without taking the tablets to see whether their blood pressure has really reduced. But that misguides us and we may unnecessarily increase the dose. Now we come to step three. Since the blood pressure is controlled, the general practitioner has one more responsibility. He has to see that the patient takes the tablets regularly, follows up regularly and keeps the blood pressure under control for the rest of his life. You should persuade the patient to continue to take the treatment. Because many patients stop the treatment saying that they have no symptoms. See the general practitioner can see them regularly, check the blood pressure and adjust the dose when necessary. With this, I will end this basic lecture on the treatment of hypertension.
