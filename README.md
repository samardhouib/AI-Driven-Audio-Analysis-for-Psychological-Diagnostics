# AI-Driven-Audio-Analysis-for-Psychological-Diagnostics
I developed a web application using Flask to automate the transcription and analysis of psychological audio recordings. The application integrates Whisper for accurate speech-to-text conversion and Mistral for analyzing the transcribed text. It generates organized PDF reports that mental health professionals can use to streamline diagnosis and track patient progress. This project demonstrates the potential of AI-driven tools in enhancing mental health assessments and improving patient care.
