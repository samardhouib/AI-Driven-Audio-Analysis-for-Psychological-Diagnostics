Generalized edema When a patient presents to you with edema, first note the distribution of the edema. If the edema is predominantly over the face around the eyes, then it is most likely to be due to a renal pathology. In children, acute glomerulonephritis or nephrotic syndrome, and in adults, glomerulonephritis or chronic renal failure. So ask and in details about the urine output, and flow, burning sensation, and color of the urine. Also ask about history of taking steroid drugs, which causes a swollen, round steroid face. Steroid drugs are taken by patients of asthma, chronic and allergic skin disorders. Then look for Severe anemia and verivary can also produce a puffy face and generalized edema. If the acytesis prominent, along with leg edema, sometimes scrotal edema, then first think of acytis due to portal hypertension. If spleen is palpable, then portal hypertension is almost confirmed. There may be history of hematemesis and history of chronic alcoholism. If the edema is mainly in dependent areas, that is legs or in wet reddened patients over the sacrum, then congestive cardiac failure is the most likely cause, followed by severe anemia and all other causes of edema. Now let me mention here that mild to moderate anemia does not produce edema. Only severe anemia, with HB less than 4 gram percent, will produce edema. and That is, clinically the tongue and conjunctiva and will be almost white, only those patients will and have edema due to anemia. Another clinical problem, often encountering generalized edema, is scrotal edema. Scrotal edema causes a lot of anxiety in patients and their relatives. But it is a harmless extension of generalized edema. Whenever the lower abdominal wall becomes edimators, the edema fluid gravitates into the scrotum. Now scrotum being a loose sac, lot of fluid collects there, producing a large swelling. Only thing you must and check, is pulpit it for tenderness. If there is no redness, no and tenderness, then you can safely tell the patient not to worry about it. But if the edema is only on scrotum, there is no generalized edema. Or if it is red or tender, then you should refer the patient to a surgeon for cellulitis or epididema or chitis. Now coming back to our patient with generalized edema, how do we approach the case? First note the distribution of edema. Where is the edema mainly located? Face, abdomen or legs. Then ask about urine output, urine color and burning. Ask about the degree of breathlessness and other cardiac symptoms. Ask history of taking steroids. An examination, look for pallor, jaundice, splino megalie, hippatomegalie, acitis and heart murmurs with dilated neck veins. If pathology is suspected, get hemoglobin, and urine and x-ray of the chest. The patients often present to the general practitioner when edema has just appeared, a full-blown picture of the disease may not be there. Also initially only a symptomatic treatment is required. Also, many cases present with very minor edema, like edema of the legs after a long travel in bus or after prolonged standing. Such patients also need and just symptomatic treatment. The symptomatic treatment is to give salt-free diet and diuretics. Ask the patient to omit salt from the diet till edema reduces, which also means avoiding high salt foods like pickles, peppers and numkins. If edema is on the legs, ask to elevate the legs at night over two pillows. Then give one tablet or half tablet of lassox daily till the edema subsides. The tablet of lassox should be given in the morning so that the diuresis occurs during daytime. If lassox has to be given for more than a week, then give a combination with potassium-sparing diuretic, like aldactone or ameloride. You can prescribe lassox lactone or amifru. If the patient is pale, add a hematonic containing iron like cap or Trin one daily. If the edema does not reduce within a week, then consult a physician and get the patient investigated. The other treatment will depend on the cause of the edema. So to summarize, in a patient with generalized edema, quickly examine and see whether there is serious underlying disorder, which needs immediate investigations. If not, give symptomatic treatment that is salt-free diet, leg and elevation and a diuretic like tablet of lassox. If the edema does not subside within a reasonable period of time, get investigations or refer to a physician. Subsequently, once the cause is detected, if there is congestive cardiac failure, with tender hipatomegalia dilated neck veins, heart murmur, then digitalization, diuretics and ACE inhibitors will be required. For renal edema, it is best to consult an effrologist. For severe anemia, blood transfusions and hematinics will be required. For steroid induced edema, steroids will have to be slowly tapered and stopped, and another drug will have to be substituted in their place. For example, in asthma, the dose of other anti-estimatics will have to be increased, and inhaled steroids will have to be given, which do not have a systemic side effect. For portal hypertension and cirrhosis, aldactone is the drug of choice, aldactone, lassox, albumin and blood transfusion will be required, and in selected cases, shunt surgery may be required.
