Low backache Low backache is a common complaint in all adult age groups, especially in females. The pain increases on bending forwards or on trying to lift weight from ground. It is particularly more intense in morning hours. Though usually backache signifies pathology in lumbosecural spine paraspinal muscles. It can also arise from kidneys in females from pelvic organ inflammation dysmenorrhea. First we will consider mild backache. If backache is mild recent of short duration, then give an anti-inflammatory drug like Diplofinac, 50 milligram TDS for 3 to 5 days, along with a calcium preparation like tab shellcal 500 milligrams. A gentle massage with Diplofinac gel or move formantations twice a day will have a soothing effect. Also see whether patient is pale because any patients often complain of backache. So if patient is pale, treat and enemy also with a hematonic. Now we will talk about another type of presentation that is chronic mild backache. If mild backache is present for a long time or comes on off repeatedly, then a long acting NSAID should be prescribed like tab over on SR 75 milligrams or worth SR 1 OD along with it calcium with vitamin D3 like tab calcium X4 or sea law should be given. And a little change in lifestyle plus back and exercises is very important to control this chronic backache. Now what is this change in lifestyle? First of all mattress used for night's sleep should be very firm. Soft sponge mattresses should be immediately discarded. Use a choir mattress or a thin cotton mattress. Secondly correct sitting posture is very important particularly for those with sedentary jobs like computer operators. Use a hard chair with back support. If that is not possible then use a lumber belt with back support. Also, height of chair should be adjusted such that legs should be firmly on ground never hanging in air. Thirdly, while lifting anything from floor patient should sit down by flexing leg then lift it stand. He should not bend forwards to lift it. The back should always remain straight. and Lastly, regular back exercises to strengthen back muscle are most useful. Lie down flat on stomach. Raise one leg at a time to 30 degrees, hold for 5 seconds then relax. Then lying down supine, fold legs with feet on floor straighten one leg in air, hold it for 30 seconds alternately. Details of exercises can be read in book. To say in short, with these measures, exercises small dose of NSAID, most of mild back kicks can be successfully treated. If there is no response, then further investigations referal to an orthopedic surgeon should be done. But before we proceed to that, let us study how to examine a patient with back kick. First, ask about severity of pain, whether it is mild or severe whether it is localized to low and back region or it radiates along legs as in sciatica disc prolapse. Then ask how it started, insidiously or suddenly. A sudden onset while bending or lifting something and is seen in prolapse interpretable disc or a sprain of paraspinal muscles. Now inspect back for any gibbers or swelling pulpit for tenderness by a firm pulsation over spines paraspinal regions. Now perform two tests, SLR test test for EHL weakness. For SLR test or straight leg raising test, ask patient to lie down supine lift one leg straight to 90 degrees. Pain at gluteal region or back means a positive test. Find angle at which pain appears. Then ask patient to dorsiflex great toe against resistance. weakness of dorsiflexion, that is and weakness of extensor heluses longest, indicates a compressive legion in spine. To summarize, inspect pulpit spine for tenderness swelling. Start patient to lie down do straight leg raising or SLR test test for power of dorsiflexion of great toe. If any of these are positive, you must consult an orthopedic surgeon. If there is any neurological deficit, motor or sensory, then you must refer patient immediately without wasting time. Also, you must consult orthopedic surgeon if pain is so severe that patient cannot walk or stand properly. Or if there is shooting pain along one leg, if there is no response to bedrest anti-inflammatory drugs. Now we will come to type of cases generally referred to as sciatica. When pain radiates from back to thigh or to leg, usually posteriorly along course of sciatic nerve, condition is termed as sciatica. This type of pain is usually associated with a positive SLR test is due to prolapse intervertebral disc or osteoarthritis of spine, where nerve roots are compressed or irritated by prolapse disc or osteophytes of vertebrae. The site of pain numbness depends on which disc is affected is compressing roots. If prolapse is of L5S1 disc, pain radiates along back of thigh leg, with numbness on back of calf soul. If prolapse is of L4-5 disc, then pain radiates along lateral aspect of thigh leg, with weakness of dorsiflexion of grade 2. And if prolapse is of L3-4 disc, pain radiates to anterior aspect of thigh leg, with difficulty in clamping stairs due to quadruceps weakness. Now we shall see how to treat these cases of acute severe backache. First of all, patient should be put to complete bedrest, of course on a firm mattress. Given injection of dichlorothinac, 3CCIM, in more severe cases, give a steroid injection, like injection decaedron 2CC IV also. This is anti-inflammatory treatment. For more severe pain, a stronger analgesic will have to be and given additionally, like injection 4-2in, or ketorolyc, or tremadol. Orally, give full dose of 1 or 2 anti-inflammatory drugs, like tab over on 51TDS, or Nimagic 100 milligrams 1BD, or tab brufin 600 milligram 1TDS, or tab worldcoxid 20 milligrams BD. Just remember that slow release preparations, that is SR preparations, should not be given for acute severe pain, they are less effective in management of acute pain relief. In addition, if pain is severe, you may give a short course of steroid, like tab Ysolone 5 milligram TDS for 5 days, or tab defnellone 6 milligrams OD for 5 days. When you give high dose NSAID, that too with a steroid you must give an anti-sid, cap Ome's PendoPresol or RebePresol. In acute pain, a tranquilizer like tab Alprazolam 0.25 milligram once or twice a and day is also useful. If there is paraspinal muscle spasm, add a muscle relaxant, like tab designed in 2 milligram TDS, or tab Robinx 500 milligram TDS, or their combinations with anti-inflammatory drugs. The drug therapy should also be complemented by complete bedrest, shortwave diathermi or SWD for Lumber Spine, which is given twice daily for 5 days, pelvic traction with 6 to 8 kilogram weight for 1 hour twice daily. When pain is severe or radiating, basic investigation that is X-ray of Lumber Sackerel Spine, LS Spine APN lateral should be taken first. Look for osteoarthritis, intervertebral disc prolapse, spondylolysthesis, or tuberculosis of spine. Since acute pain subsides, treatment will continue as we discussed for mild pain, with a Lumber Belt, back exercises, SR preparations of anti-inflammatory drugs. If pain does not subside quickly, then orthopedic surgeon will investigate further and with MRI scan of spine or myelography decide whether any operative treatment is necessary. So timely consultation with orthopedic surgeon treatment under guidance of an orthopedic surgeon is and important.
