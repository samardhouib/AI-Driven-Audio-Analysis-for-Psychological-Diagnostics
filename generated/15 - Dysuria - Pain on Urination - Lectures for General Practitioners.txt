Disuria. Disuria means pain and burning while passing urine. And the most common cause for it is tract infection or UTI. When a patient complains of burning maceration, ask precisely when does the burning pain occur? Burning pain at the end of micrution is typical of cystitis and bladder stones. While severe pain during micrution is seen in urethral infections and a stone in the urethra. Urinary infections are also associated with fever with chills, so ask about that. Then ask history of Pyruland discharge per urethra, a feature of Guno-Coccal urethritis. If yes, ask history of exposure also. In elderly patients, ask about associated prosthetic symptoms like hesitation, urgency, poor urine stream or night frequency.

Our aim of treatment will to treat the infection and and give symptomatic relief from the burning pain. First and ask for a routine urine examination, mainly looking for parcels. If parcels are present, a urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity test should done, and accordingly, the appropriate antibiotic should advised. But in general practice, it is neither practical nor necessary to advise urine culture in each and every patient. So just get a urine routine examination done and start treatment with a broad spectrum antibiotic. You can give norfloxacin 400 milligram BD or libo-floxacin 500 milligrams OD or gramoneg 1 TDS. Along with it, a alkalinizer like cital or citralca, 1 T-spoonful diluted in a glass of water three times a day should given.

The organism may resistant to the antibiotic which you have prescribed. Once you know the organism and the drugs to which it is sensitive, the correct drug can prescribed. Then ask for an and x-ray of the KUB and ultra-sonography. These detect any stones or any anatomical anomaly that may lodging the infection. If these investigations and are inconclusive, a cystoscopy may needed.
