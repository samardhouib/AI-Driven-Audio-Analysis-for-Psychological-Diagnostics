Hello and welcome to MK's Medical Review Series. My name is Dr. Moses Kazevo. I will be talking about your nature resuscitation. This may be a really bulky lecture. So please grab your note pad, grab your paper and let's go. It is very important that you know this especially as a final year student. If you are in fifth year and you are in the NECU for the first time, this is a very important aspect for you to start so that you could gain the knowledge of how to actually resuscitate new born babies. Even babies that are pretty much admitted to the NECU. So there were some major changes that we made to the resuscitation protocol or the cardio pulmonary resuscitation protocol. One of the major changes that was made is that we now institute what is known as delayed cold clamping especially in individuals that are not compromised. So in individuals that are not at risk or high risk babies. So we want to delay the cold clamping by at least about a minute and when we do this, this is actually meant to improve the ion status in actually the term infants. In addition to this, you may also actually milk the cold about four times prior to clamping in the infants that are to be requiring major resuscitation. And preterm infants will have actually noticed that they actually require less ionotropic support and fewer blood transfusions as compared to the other age groups of the neonates. And another interesting fact that we have noted from research and data analysis is that infants are born from a sci-fi and section under regional anesthesia, those between the weeks of 37 to 39 weeks without any anginital identifiable risk versus those that are born at a similar age via vaginal delivery performed at term. This actually doesn't have any significant increase in the risk of the baby requiring any endotracheal intubation. Then the other major change that was made to this resuscitation procedure or protocol is that generally the commencement of resuscitation should start using room air. And if you have a blender, please use blender. So mix room air plus 100% oxygen. And they actually isn't any significant result. So that have shown that 100% oxygen actually confers a bad advantage over room air. That's why I insist that just that on room air, then proceed to blending both room air and 100% oxygen. And of course, there is a reduced mortality that we have noted in infants that are resuscitated on room air. In addition to this, if the infant is actually to be requiring any chest compressions, so please make sure that you increase the inspired oxygen to 100%. Again, no information has been noted on the different concentrations of oxygen that may actually be needed for optimum results because no research has been done yet. We may also want to do a user pulse oximeter, which we can attach to the right hand or the wrist. And usually they are now better pulse oximeter that have now been created specifically for the use in the NICU because the conventional pulse oximeter generally don't work if the tissues of the child are generally under perfused. So we could use this as a guide to how much oxygen we're to be giving or the percentage of the oxygen that we're to be given. And with infants that are born before 32 weeks, you should actually place them in our food grade plastic wrap or bag without actually even drying them just after they are they are born. Then routine aspiration of any infant that is born and you suspect that they is meconium that has been passed during the process. We do not routine me aspirate for that as we used to do. And of course, Adrenaline that was initially given via endotrack your tube. The initial dose we don't do that anymore. We usually like to give this via an intravenous root. And of course, when you intubate and you want to confirm that your tube is in place, please use a capnometry. So a capnograph could be used, which just simply measures the amount of expired carbon dioxide. But of course, if you do not have this in the setting, I shall mention some other things that may point you towards you being able to make a diagnosis that this tube is actually within the trachea. Then of course, in some infants that have moderate to severe high HIE, which is hypoxic ischemic in cephalopathy. Either at term or near term, you can perform therapeutic hypothermia. So cooling them was certainly a standard. There are also some protocols that we shall discuss when we look at hypoxic ischemic in cephalopathy. So some key notes before we actually go into the actual steps that you have to undertake whenever you're dealing with resuscitation of the neonate. Remember that this is, this recitation is to be applying to newly born infants that are undergoing pretty much this transition from the intrauterine to living outside the uterus. But you could also use these same principles in recitation of the neonates that have already transitioned past this perinatal point. So it means that those infants that are admitted in the EQ for the first few weeks, if they require resuscitation, you could use these same points that would still be valid. These same steps are the ones that we shall carry out. And then of course, in the term newly born, in fact, the term that we're to use is newly born infant. And this term is to be used to denote that what's talking about an infant that is present at the time of birth. And then if we use the term newborn, or neonate, we're to be using this to refer to an infant that is present during the initial hospitalization. Now remember that about 10% of these newborn babies actually require some assistance to actually begin breathing at birth and less than 1% require extensive resuscitation So what you really need to notice that when a child is born, and there's something that's known as an apcoschol, which is scored out of 10. The higher the score, the better it is or the better or the less the need for resuscitation to this newborn baby. But of course, that's not really an indication of how effective your resuscitation measures are, it just points you towards the need for resuscitation there and then. If you do not know what the apcoschol is, please check it up. We shall release a video very soon on the apcoschol. I really want to take my time on this because it's a very important aspect, especially for the final year student. And remember that at delivery, they should be at least one person whose primary responsibility is pretty much the newly born baby. So this individual must actually have the skills to perform this resuscitation. They must have the skills to be able to perform in the tricule intubation. And of course, they must have the skills to administer medication. But take note that this is a teamwork thing. You may not be able to do it on your own necessarily. But if you're found in such a situation where you're on your own, you should be able to at least know what to do. So whenever you're dealing with a newly born infant, you should always ask yourself three things. Number one thing that you should ask yourself is, is this a term pregnancy? And remember that term is 37 every infant that's born at 37 weeks and beyond. So you refer to that as term in one beyond 37 weeks is term. So are they term or are they preterm? If they are preterm, how preterm are they? Is it early preterm, extreme preterm where they are even closer to even 28 weeks? So this is closer to 37 weeks, perhaps they are 36 weeks. The second question that you should ask yourself is, is this maybe crying or breathing? Okay? And is it spontaneous? The third question that you should ask yourself is, is there any good muscle tone in this newly born infant? Now if you answer all those three questions and the answer to these three questions is, yes, you get an infant that's a term that's crying and breathing very well. And that has good muscle tone. When you do not actually need to resuscitate this child, this child shouldn't be separated from the mother or you could do is simply dry up the child, place the child's skin to skin with the mother and of course cover the child with some dry linen to actually maintain the temperature. You can continue observing the breathing as activity as well as the color of the infant. Now if any one of those questions is no, so if the child is not a term, if the child is not breathing or not crying, if the child doesn't have good tone, then you should go ahead and perform one of the following steps which is how to talk about systematically. So there are some initial steps that are to be involving stabilization. So you want to provide warmth, you want to clear the airway, you want to pretty much dry this child and stimulate this child. You want to perform some ventilation, you want to perform some chest compressions and you want to administer a penifree annoyed other volume expander such as crystal oids. Now in this process of resuscitation, remember that time is really life. So the longer that you take doing this, the worse the the outcome. So you want to ensure that you're doing it at an optimal pace and you are analyzing everything optimally. So 60 minutes is what is known as the golden minute. So this is the time that's to be allocated for you to complete the initial steps for you to reevaluate and actually to begin the ventilation, you only have 60 seconds and you should be checking and assessing this child every 30 seconds. As we shall see at the end of this lecture in the algorithm, I shall show you an algorithm where you should be actually reassessing this child every single 30 seconds. Now the things that you want to look out for when you are resuscitating the two parameters that you're to monitor out obviously your respirations. So you want to look out for apnea, you want to look out for gasping, you want to look out for labor breathing or if the breathing is unlaborated. Then you also want to check your heart rate. So generally you want your heart rate to be above 100. If it's less than 100, if it's closer to 100, it may not be an issue, but it becomes an issue, especially if the heart rate is persistently below 60. An infant, a good infant, you want to get your heart rate at least above 100. Then you could actually do this by intermittently ascitating the precodeal pulse because you may not be able to popate the peripheral pulses. And when the pulse is actually detected, you may actually popate the umbilical pulse and this can actually provide you with a rough estimate of the pulse and it's actually more accurate than the other peripheral sites that you're used to. Then if you do not want to do this, like I said, there are some examinators that you could attach to the child's right hand and these could pretty much be sensing the oxygen saturation they can help you determine the pulse. Now the good thing about these pulse examinators is that there are some that are specially designed for NICU, but the conventional pulse examinators pretty much take some time for you to apply. So about one to two minutes and sometimes they may not even function when this child has a very poor cardiac output on the perfusion of the tissues are not so good. So you may face some challenges and remember time is life. The more time you're spending applying that minus you doing these resuscitative procedures, then this child is to have a much, much poor prognosis. So the evaluations that you're to be making once you institute the positive pressure ventilation or the supplementary oxygen, once you begin that, you keep monitoring the heart rate, you keep monitoring the respiration, you keep monitoring the state of oxygenation. So you do this and every single 30 minutes, 30 seconds or 30 minutes, pardon me, 30 seconds. So if the heart rate increases, this is a very good indicator that whatever you're doing is working. Okay, so if the heart rate increases and it's well and above 100, then you could actually just monitor the infant. If the respiration also improves, it's also a good sign. And then of course if the oxygen saturation is improved, it's also a good sign. We shall talk about these later on. So now if you get a child that now requires resuscitation, of course, the first thing that you should actually do is to at least call for help around you. If there's anyone that's around, call them to come in and assist you with some help. So you may get someone who is obviously to start looking at the watch. So start a stopwatch, start a timer. The time that you put the child on the resuscitate, start that timer because time is of the essence when it comes to resuscitation. You don't want to spend anything more than 10 minutes. So if you have been resuscitating a child for 10 minutes and they do not actually get better, then it's most likely that they won't. And it's most likely that you should contemplate stopping because the adverse outcomes greatly outweigh or greatly outweigh the benefits. And of course the most effective step that's to be there that you should keep in mind is ventilation. So ventilation is very key, especially in the neonates. It'd been much more important than the chest compressions. Ventilation is very key, especially in the neonates. Okay, so if you get a good ventilation, then that could be the reason why your heart rate spikes up or begins to increase. As long as these are epochs here, the heart rate, that could be one of the causes of predicate. And then of course use oxygen sparingly and of course blended with air. You could have air, but remember whenever you start doing the chest compressions, please administer 100% oxygen. You could even adapt the inflation time of the air that you're blowing into the child's chest. To actually achieve good chest movements, you could use a T-tubor or a Neopath device if possible. And please avoid overheating in-term infants after you have resuscitated them. Because this post-resuscitation care that has to be taken place, so please avoid overheating the infants, especially with the term babies. Then stop resuscitating if you still have no beats after 10 minutes. Like I told you, do not continue. Please avoid using a fluid boluses, avoid using a lock zone, avoid using bicarbonate routinely. We do not give these routinely to neonates. So keep these things in mind and keep them in the back of your mind. Every time you are seeing a resuscitation happening or on, you should always be watching the time. You should always see what the other doctors are doing in the NICU. So the step one, so these are the steps that you're to be following in order to resuscitate. I'll give you an algorithm at the end that will put everything together and summarize everything together so that you have a good understanding of how neonates are actually resuscitated. So our step one is of course to provide warmth. So you want to take the child, put them at the resuscitate, and of course this is to help with providing the warmth so they should be placed under radiant heat source. And of course you should position the child in what is known as a sniffing position. I shall show you a picture in the next two slides. So how to do this? First of all, the step one is that you're to be performing simple head extension. So simply the shoulders should row. And so they should many shoulder row or anything that's underneath or any pillow that's underneath the child. You could put the pillow underneath, I could say the back, the upper back of the child. Then of course the NIC should be wide and open. The globella as well as the chin should be horizontally aligned. I'll show you a picture just very shortly of how this looks like. Then the third thing that you should ensure and remember this is happening quickly. This is all happening in one minute. The third thing that you should ensure is that the external auditory meters as well as the sternone notch are in the horizontal plane. So here is what it looks like. So our step one here, of course simple head extension. So there should be no shoulder row or head rest. So as you can see what's happening here, the globella as well as the chin are all in one plane like so. Then second step you can see that the neck here is open and it's wide. Then you have the external auditory meters also at the same plane as the sternone notch here that the horizontal plane. So if all these things are okay, then you have achieved this sniffing position. Here's another picture to help you. Understand as we can see here we have a one here with the head rest here and a shoulder row over here. So the globella and the chin are to be horizontally aligned. The neck is to be wide open. So wide and open and of course the external auditory meters as well as a supra-sternone notch are to be in the same plane. So you refer to this as the sniffing position. Then of course we remember when you're doing your resuscitation in adult medicine, we use the approach of the ABCs. For almost every emergency we use the approach of the ABCs. The A for airway, B for breathing, C for circulation. So when it comes to the airway, remember that you want to clear the airway. So if necessary use a Bob-3 in which is what is shown here. Or you could use a suction catheter, of course dry the baby and stimulate breathing. So if the amniotic fluids in the delivery room is clear or was clear, then you only need to suction this infant. If there is any obvious obstruction due to any mucus or if this child requires positive pressure ventilation, then you could contemplate suctioning. Otherwise we do not routinely suction the airway of this infant. Then of course if meconium was present, we way back we used to suction the oral firings before delivery of the shoulder. But according to research, there has been no significant benefits of this. So we do not also routinely suction the meconium. Then you also want to check for your oxygen saturations. Remember that the blood levels in an uncompromised baby, generally are not to be reaching the values, the extra-aturine values, until this child has been outside the uterus for about 10 minutes. So which is why we usually should only go for 10 minutes. We shouldn't go beyond this. Because if this child is not improving beyond this, then the chances of them improving are very slim. So the saturations may actually be about 70 to 80% for like about several minutes. And then this child may even appear say, a noist. And some studies actually go on to show that the skin color actually is a very poor indicator of oxygen saturation. And during this intermediate or this immediate neonatal period, lack of say a noist is also a very poor indicator of oxygenation. As well as this individual who has this oxygen saturation, those are maybe poor indicators of oxygenation. Then the other thing that we are to be doing is we're to be using a pulse-oximeter. So a pulse-oximeter could actually be used. If we anticipate that this child may require resuscitation, suppose you are anticipating to receive a preterm infant. So you may already have all these things in place. You may have a pulse-oximeter already in place. So whenever you're using positive pressure ventilation, please administer the pulse-oximeter. And whenever you get a cyanosis that is persistent, or when there is a supplemental oxygen that is needed, please use a pulse-oximeter continuously. And remember that the initial resuscitation or the initial oxygen that we're to be giving is room air. Because there hasn't been any significant benefits of patients that have been started on 100% oxygen, versus patients that have been started on room air. So use room air or a blended oxygen, which ever is available. So then you have to take the oxygen concentration to achieve your target saturation. Okay, so if the baby is pretty cardiac, meaning the heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute, after about 90 seconds, then with a lower concentration of oxygen, then the oxygen concentration should be increased to 100% until you get a normal heart rate. So at one minute, your target should be roughly about 60 to 65 oxygen saturation at two minutes, 65 to 70% oxygen saturation at three minutes, 70 to 75% oxygen saturation at four minutes, 75 to 80% oxygen saturation at five minutes, 80 to 85% and then at 10 minutes, it should be at 85 to 95% oxygen saturation. That's where you should actually aim for. And if the sin-fant is actually remaining apnic despite your giving adequate oxygen, and if your heart rate still is less than 100 despite your giving oxygen, then you can start positive pressure ventilation. Then when it comes to B, remember your ABC's AOA breathing circulation, when it comes to B, which is breathing and ventilation, you want to initiate inflation following birth, which can either be spontaneous or assisted. So these simultaneous breaths or assisted breaths actually help in creating this functional residual capacity inside the child's lung. So the optimal pressure or the optimal inflation time, even the flow rate at which we should inflate these lungs to establish a good way, even in effective FRC or functional residual capacity, when we're using a positive pressure ventilation, it's not really determined from research. So generally, assistant ventilation rates should be between 42 to 60 breaths per minute. That's what's common in many hospitals. And the primary measure of adequate initial ventilation is prompt improve over the heart rate. So the heart rate is to be a very good indicator that you have really ventilated in this child. If this child is in ventilating, you should check certain things, which I'll show you on your algorithm. Then of course, just that check that the just movements of this child are happening and if the chest is moving, then you should consider other things. And then many experts actually recommend that you administer continuous positive airway pressure to infants who are breathing, even those that have a breathing spontaneously, but with difficulty following birth, although they hasn't been studies that have been done in term infants, the only studies that have been done are in pre-term infants. Then of course, you may also want to do a laryngeal mask airway or use a laryngeal mask airway that may actually fit over the laryngeal inlet. And this has been shown to have an effect for ventilating newborns weighing at least more than 2 kg or those that are delivered greater than 34 weeks to station. And of course, a laryngeal mask airway should be considered during resuscitation if the face mask isn't providing ventilation successfully or if you can't inter-bate. So it's kind of like the third option. The first thing that you want to do is first use a face mask, a well fitting, tightly sealed face mask. If that isn't really working, then you can contemplate inter-bating this child. If that fails, then your last resort, of course, will be a laryngeal face mask. And the person that's doing this must have adequate skill in being able to do this. So with the endotracheal intubation placement, you really want to initiate, this is indicated when you want to initiate endotracheal suction of non-vigorous maconium stained newborns. You also want to do this if a bag mask ventilation is in effective way using your umbo bag and face mask. And of course, when you are performing chest compressions, you should also start contemplating placing an endotracheal tube for special resuscitation circumstances, such as congenital diaphragmatic, hair near, as well as extremely low breath weight, you want to contemplate inserting an endotracheal tube. And remember that after you insert this endotracheal tube and you start administering intermittent positive pressure ventilation, there is to be a prompt rise in the heart rate. And this is a good indicator that the the tracheal tube is actually within the tracheal bronchotry and not really in the wrong place, provided that you're giving this effective ventilation. Remember that the most accurate way to determine that the endotracheal tube is within the tracheal is by measuring the exhaled carbon dioxide. That's the most accurate way to cut normal. But you may also look at other features that tend to be less reliable. So you may see missing of the endotracheal tube, you may sometimes see that the chest begins to move. Sometimes when you ascultate the lungs, you will get this eco bilateral air entry. Then we move on to see which is circulation and chest compressions. Remember that chest compressions are to be indicated if the heart rate is below 60, despite you adequately ventilating this person. You may have even intubated this person. You may be giving supplemental oxygen for 30 seconds. Remember you're to be assessing this every single 30 seconds. So because ventilation is actually the most effective thing that's to be there in neonator resuscitation, like I already told you, then chest compressions are likely to compete with this effective ventilation. That's why we usually start with the ventilation. So when the rescuer is actually performing this resuscitation, the assisted and ventilation that's being delivered to this child should be optimal before you actually contemplate starting to give chest compressions. And remember that these chest compressions are to be delivered in the lower a third of the and sternum about a depth of one-third of the anterior posterior diameter of the chest. And there are two techniques that we could use. The two thambian cycling hand technique, which is much more superior to the two finger technique. I'll show you a picture of this in the next slide. So this two thambian cycling technique, this is where you're to be placing two thambs over the sternum. And of course your other fingers will be encircling the child kind of like you're holding a door but your thumbs are in front. And of course the other fingers will be supporting the back. Then the two finger technique, you get two fingers with the second hand actually supporting the back. I'll show you a picture of how this looks like. And then of course this is recommended. The two thambian cycling hand technique is recommended in the newly born because it's to be generating a higher peak systolic values. It's to be generating higher coronary perfusion pressures. So here is a picture of the two thumb technique. As you can see, these two thambs over the lower border of the sternum like that. And the other finger supporting the back. Here's one where the infant is actually laying flat. Then of course this is a two finger technique. And then how many chest compressions are you to be doing in this neonate? Remember that compression and ventilation should be coordinated and shouldn't be simultaneous. So the chest should actually be permitted to re-expand fully before you actually compress it again. Okay. And the the fingers or the thambs of the rescuer should never leave the chest of the child until maybe after 10 minutes has gone on. Or if this child's heart rate has improved. Then we usually use a ratio of three to one. So we give compressions about 90 compressions to 30 breaths where we want to achieve about 120 events per minute to actually maximize ventilation. And that's can be achieved. And remember that each event is to be allocated half a second with exhalation or curing during the and first compression after each ventilation. So take note of this whenever you are performing the chest compressions. Then we move on to D which I shall combine drugs such as epinephrine together with the fluids. Remember that drugs are rarely indicated when you're resuscitating a newly born infant. And if the child has a bredicardia that is still persisted, this may actually indicate that there's an inadequate lung inflation. Sometimes it may indicate profound hypoxemia like I told you. And you have to ensure that you establish an adequate ventilation which is the most important step to controlling this bredicardia. And if this child's heart rate remains less than 60 despite you actually giving adequate ventilation despite you actually giving or intubating this child and giving 100 percent oxygen despite you actually performing chest compressions. Then you can actually contemplate administering epinephrine, administering some volume expansion fluids or even both. Rarely do we give buffers, narcotic antagonists such as Naloxone, rarely do we give vasopresses. So usually and these may be useful even after resuscitation but we rarely give them especially neonates. So we want to give epinephrine. So epinephrine, the root of administration is IV. We used to give it via the endotracker tube the fresh dose at least. But we usually give it IV now. So the dosage is to be 0.01 milligrams per kg, pados up to 0.03 milligrams per kg, pados. Or if you want to use mills, you could use one mill per kg which is just simply comes down to the same thing. And if we use actually a much higher dose like and 0.1 and we give it IV, it may actually result in certain nasty side effects such as hypertension even worsening of neurological functions. So that's why I want to keep it at a much lower dose. And then if we're using endotracker root in places where they're not yet updated with the newer guidelines, we use it at a dose of 0.05 to about 0.01. Though the safety of this and the efficacy of this has not yet been studied and has not yet been proven. Then of course the concentration of epinephrine that we use is 1 to 10,000. So that's about 0.01 milligrams per mill. So in one mill you get 0.01 milligrams. So let's say FH child is weighing about 10, not even 10, that's too much. 3 kg. So if the child is weighing 3 kg, so 3 by 1, so they need 3 mills. So it means that you're to be getting 3 mills per kg, so 3 mills of this solution. Okay, so if you want to change that to milligrams, so let's use a dosage of 0.01. So that's multiplied by 3, that's to be 0.03. So you're to be using 0.03 milligrams. So you take 0.03 milligrams of this. And of course you're to be repeating this after every 3, 2, 5 minutes if there is no significant improvement in the heart rate. Then we could also use some volume expansion agents. So we should consider this, especially if we have any blood loss or any suspected blood loss, it may be no, no, it may be suspected. And how do we suspect this? Number one, there's to be a pale skin, there's to be poor perfusion, there's to be a weak pulse. And of course the baby's heart rate is not to be responding to the other measures that we have instituted, the chest compressions, the intubation, clearing the airways, putting them in the right position, the epinephrine that has been given, it's not to be responding to this. So you want to give a nice, autonic crystaloid or even blood transfusion at a dosage of 10 mils per kg IV over 3 to 5 minutes, like I said, please avoid boluses. Then you also, when you're resuscitating this, premature infants, you should take care to not actually give the fluids very rapidly because this premature infants, their body systems are not yet well developed to tolerate this fluid overload. And then so this rapid infusions of these large volumes is to be associated with things like intraventricular hemorrhage. Then after now you have resuscitated the child, then the child actually has improved. And you have been doing this measures and they haven't gone past 10 minutes, you may actually offer some post resuscitation care to this infant. So the babies who require resuscitation are at high risk of deteriorating. So please make sure that you monitor the vital signs when they return to normal, monitor the ventilation, monitor the circulation, and monitor the other, the heart rate, the breathing rate, even the oxygen saturation, you may also give some drugs, but they're not really recommended. Drugs like Naloxone and is not really recommended as the initial resuscitative efforts of a newborn with especially those with respiratory depression. And the heart rate and the oxygenation are just simply good enough to increase the heart rate if you have proper ventilation. Then glucose, generally there's no specific target concentration that has been put in literature for glucose, but we may actually give an avid glucose infusion that may be considered as soon as it is practical. And one also good step that you should actually do is check the blood glucose of this infant, because this infant might be hypoglycemics. So if they are hypoglycemics, you start a glucose infusion. And then of course you may induce some therapeutic hypothermia. In some cases, like I told you in hypoxic schemicansephalopathy. So here's the algorithm I was telling you about. So I added two algorithms to this. So the first algorithm here, you get a new bone, you ask yourself those three questions, is this a term? Is this person breathing? Are they crying? Is they good tone? So if they are then routine care. So you're pretty much to be providing warmth, put them skin to skin with the mother, clear the airway if it's necessary, if there's any obvious obstruction or any obvious secretions that are blocking the airway, dry the child, and then of course continue evaluating them. Now if one of these questions, the answer is no. You obviously want to warm the child, clear the airway if it's necessary and stimulate them. If their heart rate improves, okay? Then, or if their heart rate is below 100, then you want to continue with a positive pressure of ventilation and you monitor the oxygen saturation. If their heart rate improves meaning it's not below 100, and you ask yourself is there any labored breathing or persistence diagnosis? If there's any labored breathing or persistence diagnosis, ensure that you check the airway and you clear out the airway monitor the oxygen saturation of this infant and consider doing a CPAP, or which is continuous positive airway pressure. Then if not, then this infant is okay, so routine care. Then if you are still now administering positive pressure of ventilation and still you've put the infant in that sniffing air position, you've got in your face mask and your ampubag, then you ventilate in this child adequately and still. The oxygen saturation is less than the optimal that you should get. Then if the heart rate is still below 100, then you should take some additional ventilatory corrective steps that we talked about in the lecture. So again, if the heart rate is still below 60, then we should consider it to be in the child. We should consider starting chest compressions, we should also coordinate these chest compressions with the positive pressure ventilation. Then of course, if the heart rate is still persistently below 60, we may consider giving epinephrine. Then if the heart rate still isn't increasing, then consider other things. Consider that they may be hyper-volumia, consider that they may be a pneumothorax, but of course, if this child improves, then you should of course go to post resuscitation care. These are the target oxygen saturation percentages that I gave you also in the text. Here's the second algorithm. I really loved this algorithm because we use this locally and it's actually very, very practical to do. So the first thing at birth, you're to be providing warmth, wrap the preterm babies, of course, in a plastic bag. Then you may clear the airways if necessary, drive them and stimulate them. Note the time. This is very important. Take someone to note the time. So when they start, if the child is now crying well and they are breathing well, they have good tone, then routine care. So pretty much maintain warmth, keep the airway clean, ongoing evaluation. Then after you have now assisted this, if the child is gasping or they is apnea or the heart rate is less than a hundred after 30 seconds, then you want to start your ventilation with room air. At a rate of about 40 to 60. You connect the pulse or ximiter if it's present, give the oxygen as necessary, then ensure that the chest is slightly rising with each breath. Then again, we keep on assessing the breathing. We assess the heart rate, we assess the oxygen saturation, we also assess the color. Now if the heart rate is less than 60, you start ventilating with room air still, you connect your pulse or ximiter if it's available still, you give oxygen as necessary and you still check that the chest is rising. Now if the chest is not moving, there are certain things that could be you should think about. Just remember the pneumonic moving. So M for mask seal adequate, so the face mask should have a complete seal. All for obstruction, are there any secretions or post or the position of the child? So position the child in the right position, suction any secretions, the V for ventilation, ventilate more firmly to push in more air. I assess if there is intubation that may be needed and then and assess any congenital defects such as the nasal coheno atreja, then of course G is for any gastric distation which may actually indicate that you have intubated the esophagus. Then continue assessing the breathing and the heart rate and as you can see here we're assessing every single 30 seconds. Then of course, this child will still be ventilated on room air probably at 100%. You would have connected your pulse or ximiter, you would have given oxygen, you would have also probably intubated at this point. Then if still the infant's heart rate is less than 60, you start your chest compressions and ventilation at a ratio of 3 to 1, you give you adrenaline about 0.1 to actually be supposed to be 0 point, or this is in males, 0.1 to 0.3 meals. I thought it and was in milligrams per kg. So meals per kg and you diluted 1 to 10,000 parts or you could use a 1 meal per kg adrenaline if you're giving via endotracheal tube. Of course, you may repeat this after 3 to 5 minutes. Then of course, correct any hypolimia giving your 10 meals per kg, IV over 5 to 10 minutes. If this infant doesn't still improve, then you should consider that this infant has pneumothorax and consider other causes. Of course, here is on oxygen administration. So use blended oxygen if it's available to target the pre-doctor saturation. Your pre-doctor saturation are here as I gave you a win in the prior diagram. So use these algorithms, pause this video and understand them very well because they are very important, especially when resuscitating an neonate. Now, the final key points before we end this lecture from this is that please do not go over 10 minutes. So after 10 minutes as passed, consider stopping because they are at the CFX greatly outweigh the benefits of you doing this. And of course, in infants that have a lower chance or have a very high risk of mobility and mortality, please contemplate with drawing or with holding resuscitation. We may consider that, that especially if you are in a setup where there is not so much manpower and there are so many children that require resuscitation. So with that said in mind, thank you for listening to this review lecture video on unitary resuscitation. I hope it gave you some light on how to resuscitate neonates, especially in the NICU because this is a very important topic and it may help you save some lives.
