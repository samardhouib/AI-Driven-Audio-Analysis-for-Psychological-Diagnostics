Till now, we learnt about fluid replacement in gastroenteritis. Now we shall see what other drugs are to be advised and given. I have tried to stress the importance of fluid replacement because it is the most important thing in gastroenteritis. The child will get well only fluids, no drugs, but not drugs without fluids. At the same time, it is important to control the intestinal infection and hasten the mucus al recovery by giving appropriate drugs. To control infection, we give an intestinal antibiotic. Actually, most of the cases of gastroenteritis are due to viral infection. So antibiotics are not needed. These may be given only to those cases fever, blood in the stools and or severe diarrhea. But in practice, mild antibiotic syrup is always prescribed, usually ofloxacin, septran, gramoneg that is nalidic acid and or colistin. And if bacterial infection is suspected due to fever, severe diarrhea or blood and mucus or false tools or if the child is malnourished, then injectable higher antibiotics like gentomycin, amicacin and syphilosporins should be given. Then the symptomatic treatment. If the child has vomiting, give syrup on dense satron or syrup perinom. If the child has intestinal colics and is crying, give syrup spasmindon. If frequency of the stools is more, give and tab low paramide half tablet TDS. The skin around the anus may get inflamed or excoriated if it remains wet the watery stools. So after every motions, clean and dry the buttocks, apply talcum powder and if redness of the skin is seen, apply zinc paste or silo-dom ointment. It is very very important to the skin around the anus dry. Apart from this, we consider three more drugs. A new drug is now commonly used, that is recicadotryl. Redotil 15mg sachet, dissolved in water, is given three times a day if the motions are watery. Red improves intestinal and absorption of water and reduces fluid loss. A very nice concept, but is and and still considered to be of doubtful value. The second drug is and lactobacillus. Whenever higher antibiotics are given, or if diarrhea is prolonged for more than three days, then the normal intestinal flora gets disturbed or destroyed. So we must prescribe lactobacillus. For example, lactobacillus sachet in water once daily. It helps to restore normal healthy intestinal flora and must be given after higher antibiotic treatment. Another new and commonly accepted concept is to supplement zinc, 20mg per day for two weeks, to reduce watery diaries. Prescribe zyoral or zandyssyrop or 20mg dispersible tablet once a day for 15 days, and in recurrent cases, continue it for and 4 to 6 months. At the end, understand that gastroenteritis is easily preventable. Simple hygienic precautions will prevent most cases of gastroenteritis. Find the mother to clean the nipples before breastfeeding. More care should be taken if the child is bottle fed. Boil the bottle and and the milk before every feeding. Improper cleaning and boiling of the bottle is the reason behind many diaries. Also, weaning should not be delayed. At the end of one year, the child should be eating everything that the family eats. Many that it should be in a soft form and without chilis. Many times, one and half to two years old children are still taking only milk, the result that they are malnourished and prone to develop gastroenteritis and other infections. So proper feeding at appropriate age is important. These simple practical instructions should be given by you, to the families under your care, even if they have not asked for your advice. Most children under 5 years will get 1 to 3 mild episodes of diaries in a year. But if treated in time and proper drugs and fluids, there will be no cause for worry and no dehydration. To end this lecture, let me revise what to look for and examine in a case of child water emotions. Ask about the frequency and quantity of the emotions. Is the child thirsty? Does it drink water very eagerly? Look at the skin turgar by pinching the skin over the abdomen to raise a fold and see how rapidly it flattens out when released. If anterior fontanel is present, is it turgid or sunken? Are the eyeballs sunken? And as the child lasts past urine and how much? Is the urine output scanty? Then is the pulse of good volume or rapid and 3D? How is the respiration? Rapid, shallow or deep? And is the child alert, drowsy or unconscious? Considering all these findings, decide the degree of dehydration and then institute the treatment plan and A, B or C.
