Now, before we come to the insulin dosage, let us see who needs insulin. Till now we have been talking about maturity onset diabetes, that is non-insulin dependent diabetes. In this after several years of treatment with oral drugs, the patient reaches a stage where oral drugs fail to control the blood sugar, and then insulin injections are needed. In juvenile diabetes, that is insulin dependent diabetes, it can be controlled only with insulin. Thirdly, any diabetes in a stressful condition like infection, surgery, ketoacidosis, diabetic coma, or hepatic or renal disease must be controlled with insulin. Then patients with complications of diabetes like peripheral neuritis, diabetic nephropathy or diabetic retino path, they must be controlled on insulin only. Lastly, pregnant females should also be given insulin. Insulin is available as bovine, porousine, and human insulin. Presently, human insulin is the most commonly used insulin. It is better to stick to only two types of insulin, short acting plane insulin, and long acting mixed-starred 37D. Plain insulin starts acting within 30 minutes after a subcutaneous injection, with peak action between 2 to 4 hours, and the total duration of action is over 6 to 8 hours. Mixed-starred 37D, it contains 30% plain insulin, which starts acting immediately within 30 minutes, and 70% isophan insulin, which is long acting, whose action starts after 2 to 3 hours, and the peak action is after 6 to 8 hours. The total duration of action of isophan insulin is about 24 hours. Now I will tell how to decide the dose of insulin. If are starting insulin for an acute crisis, like diabetic food, diabetic abscess, ketoacidosis, and diabetic coma, etc. Then there is no role for long acting insulin. You must start plain insulin. begin with, give 0.5 units per kg and body weight per day. For example, for a person with 50 kg body weight, start with 25 units per day, which may be given as 5, 10, 10, or 10, 10, 5. And then adjust the dose according to the blood sugar or urine sugar levels. Check urine sugar before breakfast, before lunch, and before dinner. If urine sugar is red, give 40 units. If it is orange, give 30 units. If it is yellow, give 20 units, and if it is green, 1 plus, then give 10 units. If it is blue, don't give the dose. What do we check, urine sugar or blood sugar? The blood sugar is always more accurate, but when we detect diabetes, we should also see whether the urine sugar levels match the blood sugar levels. If the renal threshold is normal, as it is in most of the patients, then can rely on urine sugar levels safely. Only in those patients whose renal threshold is abnormal, urine sugar cannot be relied upon. Now once the acute crisis or infection is controlled, can change to Lentai insulin for the convenience of a single daily dose. The dose of Lentai insulin will be 2-3rds of the total daily dose of plain insulin. Let us say a patient is controlled with plain insulin 10-20-12, that is a total of 42 units. His dose of isofen will be 28 units. And for mixtard, it will be a little more 32 units because it contains 30% plain insulin. As long as the requirement of the mixtard insulin is below 30 units, it can be given as a and single daily dose in the morning. But once it exceeds 30 units, it should be divided and into 2 doses, to 3rd dose in the morning before breakfast, and 1 third dose at night before dinner. In spite of this, if the post-prandial sugar remains high, then a third dose of plain insulin just before lunch should be given. So severe diabetes will still need 3 injections every day, even if change to mixtard. Now we come to another problem. If the total daily insulin requirement increases to more than 80 units per day, then should always consult a diabetologist. In these cases, I will only tell the general principles, if we are giving bovine insulin, we must change to human insulin. We must rule out chronic subclinical infections like pulmonary tuberculosis or urinary tract infections. Rule out thyrotoxicosis. If the patient is obese, reduce the weight on top priority. And lastly, check whether the patient is taking the insulin properly and whether absorption is hampered by lipodiscrophy or scars in the area where the injection is being given. When your patient is started on insulin, it is extremely important to educate the patient and the close-relate use about 2 aspects. Number 1 is how to take and the injection at home. You must teach the patient and one relative in the house to prepare and take the insulin injection. and Pre-filled pen type syringes, where exact dose in the units can be given by rotating a dial, have made self-injections very easy. The needles two are short and thin, so they correctly deliver the drug in the subcutaneous plane and are practically painless. But they are costly. So what I want to tell is that must teach and the patient and one relative how to clean the skin with spirit, how to fill the correct dose, how to inject and how to keep the syringes and needles sterile. Now the second aspect to teach is to understand the action of insulin to avoid hypoglycemia. If the plane insulin is given, the patient must take meals within half an hour, otherwise hypoglycemia may occur. If mixed-starred 37T is given, say before breakfast at 8am, then breakfast must be taken within half an hour, as plane insulin starts acting by them. And the peak action of the long-acting insulin will occur after 6-8 hours. This timing should not coincide with a period of starvation or exercise. Lunch must be taken before that time. Next, must teach the patient and the relatives to recognize hypoglycemia. If the patient feels excessually hungry, gets generalized sweating or sudden headache or palpitations, or he becomes irritable, there is change of behavior, or there are parastisia. Then he should immediately take sugar or anything sweet available at hand like a laddu or chocolate. If a diabetic becomes suddenly unconscious, then and it is a hypoglycemic coma and he should be rushed to a doctor to give IV glucose, because in a comatospatient and cannot give anything orally. Lastly, in severe and chronic diabetics, must teach them to take care of their legs and protect the feet from injuries, because many diabetics suffer a lot because these simple precautions are not taken. With this I will end my talk on diabetes management. I have tried to stress the basic treatment, and with this as and the base should read more details from the book. Thank you.
